    <h1>Home Library Manager</h1>
    <p>If you're seeing this, you've installed this home library manager thingy correctly! This page should show you the API for the service itself (in case you can't read the service file very well...)</p>
    <p><strong>HEADS UP!</strong>When checking for multiple authors/subjects, you need to use the brackets to denote that you're sending multiples! So
    GET '/books?subject[]=Philosophy&subject[]=Fiction' is how you would search for books that have philosophy as a subject and fiction as a subject.</p>
    <p>The same as above applies to authors as well! For both author_last and author_first!</p>
    <p>Also! When adding multiple subjects and authors, the service will only return books that match all of the given params, not any of them. For now at least.</p>
